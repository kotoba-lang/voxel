  "The `.nvdb` file container: NanoVDB segments, their headers, and the
  per-grid metadata.

  A `.nvdb` file is one or more SEGMENTS, and an uncompressed segment is
  exactly four things in a row (`NanoVDB.h`, `writeUncompressedGrid`):

      FileHeader | FileMetaData | grid name | grid buffer

  Both structs are fixed size and the layout is transcribed, not inferred,
  from `AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb` `nanovdb/nanovdb/NanoVDB.h`, read

  Two earlier iterations left this unimplemented, correctly: the sizes were
  known from `io/IO.h` but the FIELDS were not, and a reader written from
  sizes alone round-trips with itself while opening nobody else's file. The
  fields were obtainable — from the source, with a tool that does not
  summarise. That is the same lesson as Ogawa, learned twice.

  **The grid buffer itself is opaque here.** This reads and writes the
  container and its metadata — which is what `nanovdb_print` reports and what
  a pipeline needs to answer \"what grids are in this file, how big, what
  bounds\" — but it does not decode the tree inside a grid. `voxel.vdb` is
  that tree, and the two are not connected: nothing here turns a `.nvdb` grid
  buffer into a `voxel.vdb` grid, and `read-segments` returns the bytes
  rather than pretending otherwise.

  Compressed segments are REFUSED rather than mis-read: ZIP and BLOSC change
  what follows the metadata, and this decodes neither."

(def magic-strings
  "The magic numbers are ASCII read little-endian, which is why they are held
  as STRINGS here rather than as the 0x3242… constants the header prints.

  A 64-bit magic cannot survive `(reduce + (map * byte (pow 256 i)))`: those
  values are around 3.6e18, well past 2^53, so the double that comes back is
  close to the constant and not equal to it. Measured — the first version of
  this namespace compared numbers and rejected its own output. Comparing the
  eight bytes has no such range."
