(ns voxel.vdb
  "The VDB tree: a sparse voxel hierarchy with fixed branching and tiles, in
  the shape OpenVDB's `Tree4<T, 5, 4, 3>` uses.

  A dense grid pays for every voxel; an octree pays a comparison per level.
  VDB's answer is a shallow tree with wide, FIXED branching — 8^3 voxels in a
  leaf, 16^3 leaves in an internal node, 32^3 of those above — so a coordinate
  maps to a slot by shifting and masking rather than by descending a tree.
  `voxel/sparse-new` is a hash map of filled cells, which is sparse but has
  neither the locality nor the tiles; this is the structure the format is
  named after.

  What that buys, and what is measured: the active voxel count and the active
  bounding box come off the tree without visiting empty space; topology union,
  intersection and difference are set operations on active voxels; and a node
  whose children are all present and equal collapses to a TILE, so a filled
  region costs one entry rather than 512.

  **This is the data structure, not the file format.** `.vdb` and `.nvdb` are
  neither read nor written here. The NanoVDB magic numbers below were confirmed
  from the upstream header on 2026-08-23 and are recorded as a starting point,
  but the byte layout of `FileHeader` (16 bytes) and `FileMetaData` (176 bytes)
  could not be obtained without guessing — and a parser written by guessing
  round-trips with itself while opening nobody else's file. `to-edn` and
  `from-edn` are the serialisation that exists, and they say in their own error
  message that they are this library's own format.

  Not here: values other than scalars, levels beyond the three, narrow-band
  level-set operations, Blosc or ZIP compression, and delayed loading."
