(ns voxel.vdb-file
  "The OpenVDB `.vdb` file container: the header, the file-level metadata map,
  and the grid descriptors that say what grids are in the file and where.

  This is the OTHER container. `voxel.nvdb` reads `.nvdb` (NanoVDB), which is
  a different format with a different header, and the two are often confused
  because the names differ by one letter. A `.vdb` is what Houdini, Maya and
  Blender write.

  The layout is transcribed, not inferred, from
  `AcademySoftwareFoundation/openvdb` read 2026-08-24 — `openvdb/io/Archive.cc`
  (`readHeader` / `writeHeader` / `readGridCount`), `openvdb/io/File.cc`
  (`open` and `readGridDescriptors`, which fix the ORDER), `openvdb/io/
  GridDescriptor.cc` (`writeHeader` / `read` / `writeStreamPos`),
  `openvdb/MetaMap.cc` (`readMeta`), `openvdb/Metadata.h` (`read` = size then
  value) and `openvdb/util/Name.h` (`readString` / `writeString`):

      header
        int64  magic          0x56444220 (\"VDB \" as little-endian bytes)
        uint32 file version   225 at time of writing; < 221 is refused
                              UPSTREAM, not merely warned about
        uint32 library major
        uint32 library minor
        uint8  hasGridOffsets 1 when the stream is seekable
        (a compression flag lived here only for versions 222 > v >= 220)
        char   uuid[36]       ASCII hex with hyphens, NOT 16 raw bytes.
                              36 is the on-disk width; a reader that takes
                              the struct comment literally and reads 16
                              lands 20 bytes early, in the middle of the
                              metadata count.

      then, in this order (File.cc `open`)
        metadata map          uint32 count, then per entry:
                                string name | string typeName |
                                uint32 numBytes | numBytes of value
        int32  grid count
        grid descriptors      per grid:
                                string uniqueName | string gridType |
                                string instanceParentName |
                                int64 gridPos | int64 blockPos | int64 endPos

      string
        uint32 length, then that many bytes. Not NUL-terminated.

  Two things here are load-bearing and quiet when wrong:

  - **The uuid is 36 ASCII bytes, not a 16-byte binary uuid.** Reading 16
    leaves the cursor inside the metadata count, which then reads as a huge
    number and the file looks corrupt — or, worse, as a small plausible one.
  - **Every metadata value is framed by its own byte count**, so an unknown
    type can be SKIPPED exactly rather than guessed at. That is why this can
    read a file written by a newer OpenVDB with types it has never heard of,
    and report them by name.

  **The grid buffers are not decoded.** A grid descriptor gives the byte
  offsets of its grid, and this returns those offsets — which is what
  `vdb_print` reports at the file level, and what a pipeline needs to answer
  \"what grids are in this file, of what type, and how are they named\". It
  does not read the tree topology or the voxel buffers: those are ZIP or
  BLOSC compressed per node, and neither codec is implemented here. Grids are
  returned with `:grid/data-decoded? false` so a caller cannot mistake the
  descriptor for the volume.

  `voxel.vdb` is the OpenVDB `Tree4<T,5,4,3>` structure and is NOT connected
  to this: nothing here turns a byte range into a `voxel.vdb` grid. Keeping
  that seam visible is deliberate — a reader that quietly produced an empty
  tree for every grid would look like it worked."
